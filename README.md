# sysstats by feuerswut

A plugin to view your system stats (CPU, RAM, etc. on a handy dashboard, comes with a json API.)

To access, visit
/~/stats (Default: to access, login is required -> otherwise 404 not found or whatever HFS is serving under that endpoint.) 

Change the public dashboard visibility under plugin options.

**Please make sure the npm package sysstats is installed, otherwise the plugin will not start.**
